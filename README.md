<p> I created the classic arcade game of snake in Java for a 12th grade computer science assignment. I was given Game.java and GameObject.java as starter files. The SnakeGame class is a child of the Game class and contains the basic game fields, direction controls, 
collision and win/loss code. The game spawns the red apple at random locations in the board, and the player controls the snake using the arrow keys in order to get to the apple. Once the snake collides with the apple, a body object is added to the end of the snake making
it longer by 1 square. The snake object itself is really only the front square of the whole "snake". This process repeats until the snake either collides with itself or a wall and the game ends. </p>
